# Swiss Ephemeris Integration - Continuation Notes

## Current Status

We have successfully created a working JavaScript proof-of-concept (`muhurta-poc.js`) for Swiss Ephemeris integration that:
- Calculates planetary positions (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu)
- Determines tithi (lunar day), yoga, and nakshatra
- Divides the day into 15 muhurtas with start/end times
- Provides astrological data for each muhurta

## Known Issues

1. **TypeScript/ts-node Compatibility**:
   - The Swiss Ephemeris library (`sweph`) has compatibility issues with the TypeScript/ts-node environment
   - TypeScript test scripts exit silently without producing output
   - Plain JavaScript scripts run successfully with Node.js

2. **rise_trans Function Error**:
   - The `rise_trans` function for calculating sunrise/sunset times returns an error
   - Currently bypassed with an approximation (6 AM sunrise, 6 PM sunset)

## Next Steps

### Short-term

1. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Create a Node.js service wrapper around the working JavaScript implementation
   - Use child_process or similar to call the JavaScript functions from TypeScript
   - Define clear interfaces for data exchange between TypeScript and JavaScript components

2. **Sunrise/Sunset Calculation**:
   - Research correct parameters for the `rise_trans` function
   - Implement a more accurate calculation method
   - Test with various locations and dates

### Medium-term

1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Implement caching for ephemeris calculations to improve performance
   - Store frequently accessed data (sunrise/sunset times, planetary positions)

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhance error handling for edge cases
   - Provide fallback calculations when primary methods fail

3. **Optimization**:
   - Profile and optimize calculation performance
   - Minimize memory usage and calculation time

### Long-term

1. **TypeScript Integration**:
   - Investigate creating proper TypeScript bindings for the Swiss Ephemeris library
   - Consider alternative libraries or approaches if TypeScript integration remains problematic

2. **Enhanced Astrological Features**:
   - Add more advanced astrological calculations (dashas, vargas, etc.)
   - Implement more sophisticated muhurta quality assessment based on traditional rules

## Technical Decisions

1. **Library Choice**:
   - Continue with the `sweph` library by `timotejroiko` as it provides the necessary functionality
   - Use JavaScript directly where TypeScript compatibility is an issue

2. **Architecture**:
   - Separate calculation engine from UI components
   - Use a service-based approach for astrological calculations

3. **Data Flow**:
   - UI requests → TypeScript application → JavaScript calculation service → Results → UI display
